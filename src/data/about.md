# Intro

I am currently a full stack developer at Gelenk Network Inc. In this role, I am actively engaged in the development of a web application <a href="https://app.unifans.io" className="unifans-link">"Unifans"</a>. Prior to this, I obtained a master's degree in computer science from Western University in Ontario, London. Before my current role, I interned at Inspur Group for nearly a year, primarily focusing on the development for the China Telecom Data Center.
<br>
<br>
I have a deep passion for coding, and the meticulous process of problem-solving makes time fly for me. I aspire to continue working in programming-related roles, continually learning and expanding my knowledge.
