# Intro

I am currently a junior software developer and currently serve as a full stack developer at Genvoice Telecom, where I am involved in the development of a subscription-based web application. Prior to this, I obtained a master's degree in computer science from Western University in Ontario, London. Before my current role, I completed nearly a year of internship at Inspur Group, where I worked on tasks related to the data metrics center.

<br>
I am passionate about coding, and the thoughtful process of problem-solving makes time fly for me. I aspire to continue working in programming-related roles, constantly learning and expanding my knowledge.
