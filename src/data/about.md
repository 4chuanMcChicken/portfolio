# Intro

I am a junior software developer currently employed as a full stack developer at Genvoice Telecom. In this role, I am actively engaged in the development of a subscription-based web application “Unifans”. Prior to this, I obtained a master's degree in computer science from Western University in Ontario, London. Before my current role, I interned at Inspur Group for nearly a year, primarily focusing on business development for the China Telecom Data Center.

<br>
I have a deep passion for coding, and the meticulous process of problem-solving makes time fly for me. I aspire to continue working in programming-related roles, constantly learning and expanding my knowledge.
